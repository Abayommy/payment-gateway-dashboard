# Payment Gateway Dashboard - Project Charter

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: Multi-Provider Payment Gateway Dashboard  
**Project Manager**: Abayomi Ajayi  
**Start Date**: August 31, 2025  
**Target Completion**: October 26, 2025 (8 weeks)  
**Budget**: Personal project (Vercel Free/Pro tier)

## Business Case
### Problem Statement
Current challenges in payment processing operations:
- Manual monitoring of multiple payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, Square)
- Delayed detection of provider outages or performance issues
- No centralized view of transaction success rates across providers
- Suboptimal routing leading to higher processing costs
- Reactive approach to payment failures

### Expected Benefits
- **Operational Efficiency**: 50% faster incident detection and resolution
- **Cost Optimization**: 15% reduction in processing fees through intelligent routing
- **Visibility**: Real-time dashboard for all payment operations
- **Reliability**: Automated failover to backup providers
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Analytics for provider performance comparison

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 99.9% system uptime
- [ ] Sub-5-minute incident detection time
- [ ] Unified monitoring interface for all providers
- [ ] Automated cost optimization recommendations
- [ ] Complete audit trail for all transactions

## Scope Definition

### In Scope
- Integration with major payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, Square)
- Real-time transaction monitoring dashboard
- Provider health status indicators
- Transaction routing logic with failover capabilities
- Cost analysis and optimization recommendations
- Historical reporting and analytics
- User authentication and role-based access
- Email/SMS alerting system

### Out of Scope
- Direct payment processing (PCI compliance not required)
- Customer-facing payment interfaces
- Merchant onboarding workflows
- Dispute management functionality
- Multi-currency conversion

## Risk Assessment

### High-Priority Risks
1. **Provider API Rate Limits**: Implement caching and request optimization
2. **Integration Complexity**: Start with proof-of-concept for each provider
3. **Performance at Scale**: Plan for efficient data structures and caching

### Medium-Priority Risks
1. **User Adoption**: Focus on user-centered design
2. **Data Security**: Implement proper authentication and encryption
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Plan for automated testing and deployment

## Communication Plan

### Reporting Structure
- **Weekly Progress Updates**: GitHub project board updates
- **Milestone Reviews**: Detailed progress reports with demo
- **Issue Escalation**: GitHub issues with appropriate labels

### Documentation Standards
- All decisions documented in GitHub
- Code comments for complex business logic
- User guides for operational procedures
- Technical documentation for future maintainers

## Definition of Done

### Feature Completion Criteria
- [ ] Code implemented and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
